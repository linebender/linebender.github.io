Since the last update, there have been three newly released projects from Linebender:

- [![Velato's version on crates.io.](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/velato.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/velato)
 [Velato][]: A parser and driver for Lottie animation files in applications using Vello
- [![Vello SVG's version on crates.io.](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/vello_svg.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/vello_svg)
  [Vello SVG][]: Allows displaying (some) SVG documents in Vello applications
- [![Tracing Android Trace's version on crates.io.](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tracing_android_trace.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/tracing_android_trace)
  [Android Trace][]: Resilient bindings to [NDK Tracing][] and an integration with [tracing][]

<!-- TODO: Gif of Velato? -->

Implementation work for [rfc#1][] has started. Masonry is being ported to Vello in [masonry#56][], with the next step being a move to Winit.
This work can be followed in the [#masonry][] stream on Zulip.

We have landed some important improvements to Vello.
Euler spiral based stroke expansion ([vello#496][]) enables GPU stroking by default, significantly improving performance in scenes which make heavy use of strokes.
Additionally, we now support scenes with more draw objects ([vello#526][vello#526]), which was another issue called out.
We have also been making progress on [vello#366][], by evaluating different strategies for memory allocation.
The first part of this has landed in [vello#537][], which avoids undefined behaviour in more out-of-memory cases.

Additionally, we have been able to continue taking advantage of improvements in the [foundational font crates][fontations] from Google Fonts.
This has enabled support for font fallback in [xilem#196][].
Hinting has been unblocked by [vello#544][], although the implementation has not yet landed in Xilem.

[rfcs#5][] has been approved, which will improve the robustness of our continuous integration.
Kaur Kurt, the author of the RFC, has also landed these changes in [Vello][vello msrv].

A focus for the next month is preparing for the [RustNL conference][] at the beginning of May.
We are hoping to present a compelling demo there.
