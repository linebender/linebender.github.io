This month saw contributions on Linebender projects from volunteer contributors.
Philipp Mildenberger especially is a major driver for progress on Xilem and especially the `xilem_web` crate.

## Xilem

- [xilem#423][] integrates Tokio into Xilem, showing how the Xilem model can interact with async work.
- [xilem#428][] by Philipp adds explicit support for Flex parameters.
- [xilem#440][], [xilem#448], etc add support Async support and experiments in Xilem Web

## Masonry

The most impactful change on the Masonry side was implementing the ["Widgets in arenas" RFC](https://github.com/linebender/rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0006-widgets-in-arenas.md) in [xilem#396][].
Widgets are now stored in a global arena, which has little impact on the public APIs but make future changes a lot easier to implement.

- [xilem#417][] exposes an unstable API for embedding Masonry and Xilem into an existing Winit application.
- [xilem#418][], [xilem#421][] improved our unofficial support for iOS.
- [rfcs#7][] specifies a clearer architecture for passes, including simplifications necessary for compositor use.
  Actually integrating with the compositor is still out of scope [for reasons Raph has laid out before](https://raphlinus.github.io/ui/graphics/2020/09/13/compositor-is-evil.html), but the new pass specification gives us a starting point when we get there.

## Vello

- The [GPU-friendly Stroke Expansion](https://linebender.org/gpu-stroke-expansion-paper/) paper has been released. 
  Follow the link for the outline, the full paper, demos, and a talk at the HPG 2024 conference.
- [Vello 0.2.1](https://github.com/linebender/vello/releases/tag/v0.2.1) has been released.
  This patch version resolves a longstanding crash around empty scenes.
- [vello#643][], [vello#647][] switch to Git LFS for storing snapshot test files.
  Git LFS is an open-source Git extension supported by Github, that lets users commit large files to a repository without permanently bloating it.
  Using it has trade-offs around bandwidth usage in CI, but otherwise matches our use-case perfectly.

## Parley

Nico Burns contributed quite a few improvements to Parley this month:

- [parley#67] implements inline box layout, which lets us mix textual and non-textual content and have the non-textual content laid out in flow with the text.
- [parley#76], [parley#84] gets style types closer to CSS engines.

## Others

- [The Glazier repository](https://github.com/linebender/glazier/) has been archived.
  This is in continuity with our direction so far, as we've dropped support for it and committed to building our crates on top of Winit.
- We are at the end of our documented [May-July 2024 roadmap](@/blog/2024-06-17-roadmap-may-2024.md).
  We expect to do a full retrospective on it soon, incuding the items we shipped and those that slipped.
- Daniel is now accepting "office hours" style appointments, for open-ended discussion of the ecosystem.
