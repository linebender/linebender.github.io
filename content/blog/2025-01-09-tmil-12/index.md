Linebender is an informal open-source organization working on various projects to advance the state of the art in GUI for [the Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org).

We'd like to wish everyone a happy New Year!

## Peniko

Peniko provides a set of shared types for concepts that are important for drawing/stroking paths, but excluding the path geometry itself (which can be found in kurbo).
It includes types for brush styles (including gradient) and color.

Last month, we continued down the path to supporting a richer color model and wider gamuts.
We released [Peniko 0.3.0] which replaces the old color code with our new [Color] crate.

* [peniko#63]: Use the Color crate
* [peniko#71]: `Gradient` now tracks a hue direction and interpolation color space
* [peniko#77]: Add x/y extend modes and quality hint to images

## Color

Color provides functionality for representing, converting, parsing, serializing, and manipulating colors in a variety of color spaces.
It closely follows the [CSS Color Module Level 4] draft spec.

Last month, we released [Color 0.2.0] and [Color 0.2.1].

The release of Color 0.2.0 contained a significant amount of work to enable use with Peniko and the rest of the Linebender stack.

Color 0.2.1 included improvements to parsing.

* [color#109]: Make color parsing case insensitive
* [color#111]: Add `FromStr` impl for `AlphaColor`, `DynamicColor`, `OpaqueColor`, and `PremulColor`

We encourage people to give [Color] a try and let us know how it goes.

## Vello

Vello is our GPU vector renderer.
It can draw large 2D scenes with high performance, using GPU compute shaders for most of the work.

Vello is now using the new Peniko 0.3 release along with the Color crate.

* [vello#757]: Remove `buffer_labels` feature as it is no longer optional
* [vello#761]: Remove work-around for `const` / `let` globals in WGSL
* [vello#768]: Migrate to notify-debouncer-full
* [vello#774]: Initialize wgpu `InstanceDescriptor` from environment

## Parley

Parley is a text layout library.
It handles text layout, mostly at the level of line breaking and resolving glyph positions.

* [parley#193][]: Added snapshot tests for text selection areas and cursor positioning
* [parley#192][]: Changed the `PlainEditor` abstraction to reduce unneeded work
* [parley#224][]: Exports the text selection area, ensuring that input selection boxes don't overlap content
* [parley#227][]: Adds infrastructure for easy to understand tests for text editing functionality

## Kompari

[Kompari] is a tool for visual inspection of snapshot tests.
This project is a new addition to Linebender, generously contributed by [Ada BÃ¶hm][spirali] and is currently in pre-alpha.

The report has a section called 'test1.png', which shows that two images of the text 'Linebender' have 2482 different pixels. An image displaying which pixels are different is next to these." height="1040" width="2364">

We plan for Kompari to standardise and improve the developer experience of snapshot tests in Linebender (and beyond).
It can generate reports which summarises failed snapshot tests, and will also contain functionality for interactive blessing of new snapshots.
This reporting can be integrated into a repository as an xtask:

```commandline
cargo xtask report
```

Kompari also includes a standalone CLI, for projects which don't use the xtask pattern or are trialling Kompari.

In December, we added initial functionality and established CI in the repository.
Ongoing work includes:

* [kompari#12]: Refactoring the project to make it more modular
* [kompari#13]: Interactive test blessing

## Masonry

Masonry is the widget system used by Xilem.
It provides a non-opinionated retained widget tree, designed as a base layer for high-level GUI frameworks.

Updates to Parley integration and usage for IME and text editing:

* [xilem#766]: Update to upstream unbatched PlainEditor
* [xilem#767]: Stop IME just before shutting down
* [xilem#768]: Clear compose in `TextArea::reset_text`
* [xilem#785]: Improve IME area reporting and set IME area in `TextArea`

The new tree arena landed and saw some performance improvements:

* [xilem#752]: Tree arena
* [xilem#772]: Use hashmap to track tree arena node children
* [xilem#774]: Use `hashbrown` as drop-in replacement to optimize tree access

We updated to start using the Color crate:

* [xilem#798]: Update to git Parley and Vello (uses Color)
* [xilem#800]: Use `palette` and `Color` from top level Masonry and Xilem

Miscellaneous:

* [xilem#777]: Render one frame before showing the window to avoid flashing
* [xilem#795]: Sized Box: Use a brush for the border

## Xilem

Xilem is our flagship GUI project, inspired by SwiftUI.
It lets you build user interfaces declaratively by composing lightweight views together, and will diff them to provide minimal updates to a retained layer.

* [xilem#797]: The text colour and other properties inside buttons can now be customised

## Research and Future Directions

Linebender has an origin story in being a very research oriented group, looking to break new ground.
While we are focused on shipping code today, we still have an eye on the future and how to be prepared for the new opportunities and technologies that are coming.

We have a couple of active and ongoing research projects:

* Raph Levien on SIMD, stroke expansion, and new rendering approaches for Vello.
* Joe Neeman on boolean path operations.
* A potential revival of the Piet project, [discussed on Zulip][Low-level Piet].

## Get Involved

We welcome collaboration on any of our crates.
This can include improving the documentation, implementing new features, improving our test coverage, or using them within your own code.

We host an hour long office hours meeting each week where we discuss what's going on in our projects.
See [#office hours in Zulip](https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/359642-office-hours) for details.

* Daniel and Olivier's "office hours" appointments can still be booked by anyone for open-ended discussion of the ecosystem.
  * [See Daniel's schedule here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ32eQYJ9DtZ_wJaYNtT36YioETiloZDIdImFpBFRo5-XsqGzpikgkg47LPsiHhpiwiQ1orOwwW2).
