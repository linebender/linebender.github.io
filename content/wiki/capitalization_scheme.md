title = "Capitalization scheme for Linebender projects"
+++

All Linebender projects should follow this capitalization scheme:

- The project's name should start with an uppercase letter when referring to the project itself, eg Vello.
- The name should be all-lowercase where referring to the project as a Rust crate (for instance, in relation to crates.io).
In that case, it's encouraged to use backticks to put the project name in a codeblock, eg `vello`.
- The name should be all-lowercase where referring to the project as a GitHub repository.
In that case, it's encouraged to either use backticks or make it a link, eg [vello#1](https://github.com/linebender/vello/pull/1).

Feel free to correct any documentation you see to follow this scheme, unless the project is explicitly discontinued or in maintenance mode (eg Xi-Editor, Piet).
